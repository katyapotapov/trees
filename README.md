Tree so far - uses binary tree L-system, expanded to 3D (so it's a 6-ary tree now):

# Todos

## Highest priority
- [ ] Add different branch lengths, especially for trunk
- [ ] L system editor/toggler
- [ ] Sliders for all other parameters
- [ ] Add more L systems
  - What are the limits of L systems for designing realistic trees? e.g. we can't really express a long trunk with an L system (although this could be solved with branch length)

## Second priority
- [ ] Add leaves
- [ ] Add different leaf/bark colours

## Nice to haves
- [ ] Add cool background and ground (like aurora borealis, sunset type situation)
- [ ] Maybe even add some particles moving through the scene? Weather appropriate, snowflakes or pollen
- [ ] Add physics and precip/weather (the tree should respond to wind/rain/snow to look more natural)
