# Todos

## Highest priority

- [x] Add different branch lengths, especially for trunk
- [ ] Try parametric systems for tree generation
- [ ] L system editor/toggler
  - Make sure the L system is actually legible to somebody editing it (eg +Y / -Y instead of $ / &)
- [ ] Sliders for all other parameters
- [ ] Add more L systems
  - What are the limits of L systems for designing realistic trees? e.g. we can't really express a long trunk with an L system (although this could be solved with branch length)

## Second priority

- [ ] Add leaves
- [ ] Add different leaf/bark colours
- [ ] Allow branch radius to be tapered via a function (ie log)
- [ ] Maybe angle too

## Nice to haves

- [ ] Add cool background and ground (like aurora borealis, sunset type situation)
- [ ] Maybe even add some particles moving through the scene? Weather appropriate, snowflakes or pollen
- [ ] Add physics and precip/weather (the tree should respond to wind/rain/snow to look more natural)
